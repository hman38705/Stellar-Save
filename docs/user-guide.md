# Stellar-Save User Guide

Welcome to Stellar-Save, a decentralized rotational savings and credit association (ROSCA) built on the Stellar blockchain. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to participate in community-based savings groups.

## What is Stellar-Save?

Stellar-Save brings traditional ROSCA systems to blockchain technology. Members contribute a fixed amount regularly, and each member receives the total pool on a rotating basis. This creates:

- **Trustless savings**: No central coordinator needed
- **Transparent transactions**: All activity is verifiable on-chain
- **Global accessibility**: Anyone with a Stellar wallet can join
- **Automated payouts**: Smart contracts handle distributions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Stellar Wallet**: Install a compatible wallet like [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/) or [Lobstr](https://lobstr.co/)
2. **XLM Funds**: You'll need Stellar Lumens (XLM) for contributions and transaction fees
3. **Internet Connection**: Access to the Stellar network

### Setting Up Your Wallet

1. Install your preferred Stellar wallet
2. Create or import a Stellar account
3. Fund your account with XLM (available from exchanges or faucets)
4. Connect your wallet to the Stellar-Save dApp

### Network Selection

Stellar-Save operates on:
- **Testnet**: For testing and learning (recommended for beginners)
- **Mainnet**: For real savings groups with actual value

Start with testnet to familiarize yourself with the platform.

## Creating a Group

As a group creator, you set the terms for your savings circle.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Access the dApp**: Navigate to the Stellar-Save interface
2. **Connect Wallet**: Click "Connect Wallet" and approve the connection
3. **Select "Create Group"**: Find this option in the main menu
4. **Configure Group Settings**:
   - **Contribution Amount**: How much each member contributes per cycle (in XLM)
   - **Cycle Duration**: How often contributions are due (e.g., weekly, monthly)
   - **Maximum Members**: Total number of participants (2-50 recommended)
   - **Minimum Members**: Minimum required to start the group
5. **Review Terms**: Double-check all settings
6. **Create Group**: Sign the transaction with your wallet
7. **Share Group ID**: Distribute the group identifier to potential members

### Best Practices for Group Creation

- **Realistic Amounts**: Set contribution amounts members can afford
- **Familiar Cycles**: Choose durations that work for your community's schedule
- **Trusted Members**: Start with people you know for your first group
- **Clear Communication**: Discuss expectations with potential members beforehand

## Joining a Group

Participate in existing savings groups created by others.

### Finding Groups

1. **Browse Groups**: Use the "Browse Groups" or "Join Group" section
2. **Search by ID**: If you have a specific group ID, enter it directly
3. **Filter Options**: Look for groups by:
   - Contribution amount
   - Cycle duration
   - Current member count
   - Group status

### Joining Process

1. **Select Group**: Click on a group that interests you
2. **Review Terms**: Carefully read the group rules and requirements
3. **Check Compatibility**: Ensure you can meet the contribution schedule
4. **Join Group**: Click "Join" and approve the wallet transaction
5. **Confirm Position**: Note your payout position in the rotation

### What to Consider Before Joining

- **Trust Level**: How well do you know the group creator and other members?
- **Financial Commitment**: Can you reliably make contributions on schedule?
- **Group Size**: Larger groups mean longer waits for your payout but potentially more stability
- **Duration**: Consider how long you're willing to wait for your turn

## Contribution Process

Regular contributions are the heart of the ROSCA system.

### How Contributions Work

- **Fixed Amount**: Everyone contributes the same amount each cycle
- **Set Schedule**: Contributions are due at regular intervals
- **All or Nothing**: The full pool is distributed only when all members contribute
- **Automatic Tracking**: The smart contract records all contributions

### Making a Contribution

1. **Check Due Date**: Monitor your group's contribution deadline
2. **Access Group**: Go to "My Groups" and select your active group
3. **View Status**: See current cycle progress and who's contributed
4. **Contribute**: Click "Contribute" and approve the XLM transfer
5. **Confirm**: Wait for transaction confirmation on the blockchain

### Contribution Deadlines

- **Cycle Start**: Timer begins when the group becomes active
- **Extension Period**: Groups may have grace periods for late contributions
- **Consequences**: Missing contributions may affect your standing or payout eligibility

### Tracking Your Contributions

- **Contribution History**: View all your past payments
- **Cycle Progress**: See how many members have contributed this cycle
- **Total Saved**: Track your cumulative contributions
- **Payout Eligibility**: Monitor when you'll receive funds

## Payout Mechanics

Understanding how payouts work ensures you know what to expect.

### How Payouts Work

1. **Pool Formation**: All members' contributions create the cycle pool
2. **Rotation Order**: Members receive payouts in the order they joined
3. **Automatic Distribution**: Smart contract triggers payout when all contribute
4. **Full Amount**: Each member receives the total pool amount

### Payout Process

1. **Cycle Completion**: All members must contribute for the cycle to complete
2. **Automatic Trigger**: Smart contract detects completion and initiates payout
3. **Recipient Selection**: Next member in rotation receives the funds
4. **Instant Transfer**: Funds are transferred directly to the recipient's wallet

### Payout Schedule

- **Position-Based**: Your payout position is determined by join order
- **Sequential**: Payouts happen one at a time as cycles complete
- **Predictable**: You know exactly when your turn will come

### Receiving Your Payout

1. **Monitor Progress**: Watch as cycles complete
2. **Automatic Transfer**: Funds appear in your wallet automatically
3. **Transaction Record**: All payouts are recorded on the blockchain
4. **Continue Contributing**: Keep contributing even after receiving your payout

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is my money safe?**
A: Your contributions are held by smart contracts on the Stellar blockchain. While smart contracts reduce counterparty risk, always research and understand the platform before participating.

**Q: What happens if someone doesn't contribute?**
A: If a member misses their contribution, the cycle cannot complete and no one receives a payout. Groups should establish clear expectations and consequences.

**Q: Can I leave a group early?**
A: This depends on the group's rules. Some groups may allow withdrawal, but you typically forfeit future payouts.

**Q: Are there fees?**
A: Transaction fees are minimal (Stellar network fees), but the platform itself is free to use.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What wallet should I use?**
A: We recommend Freighter for its good Soroban support. Other compatible wallets include Lobstr and StellarX.

**Q: How do I get test XLM?**
A: Use the Stellar testnet faucet at https://laboratory.stellar.org/ to get free test XLM.

**Q: What if I lose my wallet?**
A: Your funds are tied to your Stellar account. Recover your wallet using your backup seed phrase.

**Q: Can I use this on mobile?**
A: Yes, through compatible mobile wallets that support Stellar and Soroban contracts.

### Group Management

**Q: How do I change group settings?**
A: Only the group creator can modify settings, and only before the group becomes active.

**Q: What if my group doesn't fill up?**
A: Groups can start with minimum members, but work best with full participation.

**Q: Can I be in multiple groups?**
A: Yes, but ensure you can meet all contribution schedules.

**Q: How do I know if a group is legitimate?**
A: Check the contract address, read reviews, and verify with other participants.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: My transaction is stuck**
A: Check Stellar Explorer for transaction status. Network congestion can cause delays.

**Q: I can't connect my wallet**
A: Ensure your wallet is unlocked and supports the current network (testnet/mainnet).

**Q: Contribution failed**
A: Verify you have sufficient XLM for both the contribution and transaction fees.

**Q: Wrong contribution amount**
A: Contributions must match the group's exact amount. Check the group settings.
